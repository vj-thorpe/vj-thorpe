Hi, I’m V.J. 👋🏾

I'm a producer/musician, graphic artist, intermediate programmer and film junkie - Welcome to my github page…

🎧 Currently I'm working on a music website (Beatbase.co.uk) where users can upload and stream music. The plan is to continue to build and evolve it to include more and more innovative features so it can hold up with other established streaming sites.

🎬 I'll soon be simultaneously building a personal website to showcase all of my personal ventures and professional endeavours.

you can reach me on vj_thorpe@outlook.com. ✨ Thanks for visiting my page!
